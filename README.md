## üìò Overview

This project simulates real-world cyber threats in a controlled lab environment and demonstrates how to detect, investigate, and respond to them using **Splunk (SIEM)** and **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** tools. The lab incorporates endpoint logging, scripted automation, threat intelligence enrichment, and compliance alignment with security frameworks.

Each phase‚Äîfrom attack simulation to automated remediation‚Äîis supported by modular scripts and visualizations. A series of detailed sub-READMEs accompany this repository to explain the configurations, detection logic, and scripting methodologies used throughout the project.

## üéØ Objectives

- Deploy a realistic detection and response environment.
- Simulate cyber attacks against Windows/Linux hosts.
- Correlate logs and detect malicious behaviors using Splunk.
- Automate investigation and response with SOAR playbooks.
- Enrich threat context via external intelligence sources.
- Map activities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Document procedures for reporting and compliance reviews.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- **SIEM Monitoring & Log Correlation**  
  *Built dashboards and detection rules in Splunk using event correlation from Sysmon and Winlogbeat data.*

- **Incident Response & Threat Detection**  
  *Simulated adversary behaviors and manually triaged logs to identify indicators and alert patterns.*

- **Scripting & Automation**  
  *Developed Python and PowerShell-based SOAR playbooks to automate threat enrichment, ticketing, and response tasks.*

- **Security Documentation & Reporting**  
  *Generated incident response write-ups, detection signatures, and remediation workflows.*

- **Governance, Risk & Compliance**  
  *Applied mock retention policies and NIST-aligned compliance controls across the lab environment.*

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**  
  *Mapped detection rules and alerting logic to relevant ATT&CK TTPs.*

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**  
  *Used VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB APIs to enrich indicators and confirm malicious activity.*

- **Operating System Internals**  
  *Executed and analyzed host-based attacks on both Windows and Linux to generate meaningful logs.*
