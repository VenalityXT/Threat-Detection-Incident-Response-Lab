## Overview

This project simulates real-world cyber threats in a controlled lab environment and demonstrates how to detect, investigate, and respond to them using **Splunk (SIEM)** and **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** tools. The lab incorporates endpoint logging, scripted automation, threat intelligence enrichment, and compliance alignment with security frameworks.

Each phase, from attack simulation to automated remediation, is supported by modular scripts and visualizations. A series of detailed sub-READMEs accompany this repository to explain the configurations, detection logic, and scripting methodologies used throughout the project.

---

## Objectives

- Deploy a realistic detection and response environment.
- Simulate cyber attacks against Windows/Linux hosts.
- Correlate logs and detect malicious behaviors using Splunk.
- Automate investigation and response with SOAR playbooks.
- Enrich threat context via external intelligence sources.
- Map activities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Document procedures for reporting and compliance reviews.

---

## Skills Learned

- **SIEM Monitoring & Log Correlation**  
  *Built dashboards and detection rules in Splunk using event correlation from Sysmon and Winlogbeat data.*

- **Incident Response & Threat Detection**  
  *Simulated adversary behaviors and manually triaged logs to identify indicators and alert patterns.*

- **Scripting & Automation**  
  *Developed Python and PowerShell-based SOAR playbooks to automate threat enrichment, ticketing, and response tasks.*

- **Security Documentation & Reporting**  
  *Generated incident response write-ups, detection signatures, and remediation workflows.*

- **Governance, Risk & Compliance**  
  *Applied mock retention policies and NIST-aligned compliance controls across the lab environment.*

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**  
  *Mapped detection rules and alerting logic to relevant ATT&CK TTPs.*

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**  
  *Used VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB APIs to enrich indicators and confirm malicious activity.*

- **Operating System Internals**  
  *Executed and analyzed host-based attacks on both Windows and Linux to generate meaningful logs.*
